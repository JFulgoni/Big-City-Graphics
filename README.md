## John Fulgoni, COMS 4160 Spring 2015

This is the source code for my final project COMS 4160.
[Check it out on YouTube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV0mXMTP3EI)
Official write up can be found [here](jsf2154_final.pdf)

The scene consists of an open world environment, where the player can control his character
while other characters and models are animated around the city.
Models are either made by me, or imported from TurboSquid (see sources in my pdf)
